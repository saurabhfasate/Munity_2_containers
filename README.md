### Problem Statement
In Sprint 1, we created a community-based social media where users can join communities and share their thoughts, interests, opinions which can be viewed by other users. User can like posts and leave comments. They can view a feed of posts from communities they have joined. They can also view posts from people they follow.
We had to deploy this Spring Boot + PostgreSQL application to GCP using Docker and Kubernetes.
